# github-issue-cloner Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Rapid Prototyping First
All new features must begin with a functional, interactive prototype. The goal is to validate the user experience and core functionality with minimal initial investment. Prototypes should be built using the fastest available tools and methods, even if they are not the final production technologies.

### II. Consistent User Experience
The user interface and interaction patterns must be consistent across the entire application. Adherence to a shared design system, component library, and style guide is mandatory. Any deviation must be justified and approved.

### III. User Feedback is Paramount
Prototypes and new features must be tested with target users at the earliest possible stage. Feedback should be systematically collected, analyzed, and used to iterate on the design and functionality.

### IV. Iterate and Refine
The initial prototype is not the final product. The development process must be iterative, with a clear path from prototype to production-ready code. Refinement should be guided by user feedback and technical requirements.

## Governance
This Constitution is the single source of truth for project principles and supersedes all other practices. All project development and review processes must verify compliance with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require documentation, review, and approval from the project maintainers.
